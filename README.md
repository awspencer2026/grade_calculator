My first Python program created on 12/01/2023 as my final project for IT 109 is a simple text-based grade calculator. I plan on expanding it with my newly obtained OOP knowledge in the future.

This folder contains the following .py files:
1. grade_calculator_utility.py - this is the back end of the program
2. grade_calculator_application.py - this is the front end of the program


This folder also contains the following files:
1. report_card.txt - this is the output for the report card
2. report.pdf - this is the report for the project


How to run the code:

1. Open the grade_calcultor_application.py file in IDLE
2. Hit RUN or press F5


Input Instructions:

1. When adding an assignment's grade, do not include the percent sign. If the assignment's grade is 90%, input it as 90. 
2. When adding an assignment's weight, input the weight as a decimal. If the assignment's weight is 50%, input it as 0.5.
